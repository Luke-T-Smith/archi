    documentation="Launched officially as part of BB upgrade 2016.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Re Plagarism&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;(after a pilot:) Our recent QAA Higher Education Review affirmed that, now the technology allows for it, the system should be used more routinely.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The tool compares studentsâ€™ work submitted online with sources (including the web, ProQuest ABI/Inform, local and global databases of submitted papers) and highlights matches so that markers can recognise sources used and check they have been referenced correctly. It will also highlight possible collusion within a cohort and, over time, across years. Colleagues are also able to upload sources (e.g. specific articles or lecture slides) to our local database for the system to check against."/>
