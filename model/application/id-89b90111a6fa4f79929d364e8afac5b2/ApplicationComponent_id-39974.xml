    documentation="Peter Daniel, Printing and Stationery (ITS): On Tuesday 23 June, Printing and Stationery and IT Services will be conducting an essential upgrade of the Blueprint print monitoring software. This means that printing will not be available from 5:00pm on Monday 22 June until midday on Tuesday 23 June.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The main print servers will be unavailable during this time, which will cause disruption to all university printing. We shall ensure that the down time is kept to a minimum, however to limit the impact we ask that all colleagues plan ahead for their printing needs."/>
