    documentation="A perl integration managing multiple integrations in one. The integration handles multiple integrations in one, because BB needs multiple file import – staff, students etc. A nightly dump from ISIS, compares with the previous night’s dump, sends an excerpt of each file where data has changed (delta files) e.g. 5 changed student records. This was done latter half of 2016 in prep for BB new integration. Currently BB takes all the data (not the just changed). 2 stages to the feed – SQL extract (all the rules at this stage), then manipulation to produce files for BB&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It would be relatively easy to adapt BB business logic. NB BB marks are not tied down till signed off, after which they are imported back into ISIS.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;NB There are different integrations between ISIS and BB: Marks and Assessment is completely separate to this one, sep to updating BB with current students.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Could run a closer-to-realtime integration between ISIS and BB - talk to Kevin L who would prob beon the side of keeping BB-ISIS integrations pretty stable in implementation terms. Need to test why any big changes would be needed. Might be better to manipulate the business rules re ARC to map better to what's in BB. Find out what is the prob- is it what students see or staffsee that is the problem? Or the placement people seeing marks?"/>
