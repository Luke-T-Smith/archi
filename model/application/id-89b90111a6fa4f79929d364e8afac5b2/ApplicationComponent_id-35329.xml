    documentation="JAMROOM development by Library team&#xA;&#xA;Large amounts of staff time have been invested in both developing the Academic Skills framework, and designing content to sit within it.  We envision this is a long term commitment to developing our own platform, using open access software, and serving the needs not only of UWE Library Services, but potentially as an elearning platform that could be used by other departments.  Partnerships with Careers, Health &amp; Applied Sciences and RBI are already being looked at. The content is already being used in assessed pieces of work, contributing to module and programme achievement, and has potential to contribute towards improved student experience, NSS, and TEF assessments at university level. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The platform is running open source Content Management System (CMS) software called Jamroom.  Jamroom appears to use modules, profiles, skins and workbooks. The system is currently backed-up to the Amazon cloud but has no data processing agreement in place. I have already informed Emma that they are unable to continue backing up to the Amazon cloud without a data processing agreement in place."/>
