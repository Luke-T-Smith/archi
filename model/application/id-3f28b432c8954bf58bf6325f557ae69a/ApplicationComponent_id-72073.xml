    documentation="Large amounts of staff time have been invested in both developing the Academic Skills framework, and designing content to sit within it.  We envision this is a long term commitment to developing our own platform, using open access software, and serving the needs not only of UWE Library Services, but potentially as an elearning platform that could be used by other departments.  Partnerships with Careers, Health &amp; Applied Sciences and RBI are already being looked at. The content is already being used in assessed pieces of work, contributing to module and programme achievement, and has potential to contribute towards improved student experience, NSS, and TEF assessments at university level.?"/>
